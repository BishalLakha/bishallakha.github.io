Hi! I am Bishal, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Boise State University, advised by [Dr.Edoardo Serra](https://sites.google.com/site/serraedoardo/). My research focuses on developing reliable and scalable Graph ML-based algorithms, primarily for anomaly detection and cybersecurity. In addition, my goal is to improve explainability of such models by creating two types of generative explainers: language-based explainer, based on GNN and LLM, and causal subgraph-based explainer, based on VAE and diffusion model.

Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science, also at Boise State University. My undergraduate studies was in Electronics and Communication Engineering, undertaken at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal.
