Hi! I am Bishal, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Boise State University, where I am collaborating with my advisor, Dr. [Edoardo Serra](https://sites.google.com/site/serraedoardo/). My research primarily delves into the realms of Graph Representation Learning, Graph Explainability, and Anomaly Detection, with a specific focus on their applications in Cyber Security.

Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science, also at Boise State University. My undergraduate studies were in Electronics and Communication Engineering, undertaken at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal.
