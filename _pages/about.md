Hi! I am Bishal, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Boise State University, where I am collaborating with my advisor, Dr. [Edoardo Serra](https://sites.google.com/site/serraedoardo/). My research focuses on developing reliable and interpretable Graph ML-based algorithms, primarily for anomaly detection and cybersecurity. My goal is to improve model explainability by creating two types of generative explainers: language-based explainers, which use GNNs and LLMs, and causal subgraph-based explainers, which use VAEs and diffusion models.

Prior to this, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science, also at Boise State University. My undergraduate studies were in Electronics and Communication Engineering, undertaken at the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal.
